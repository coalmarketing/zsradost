Hi, I’m Canadian Lisa and although I studied Philosophy and Politics at university in Canada, I’ve been teaching English as a second language (ESL) for almost 25 years, (17 years here in the Czech Republic), as a freelance teacher AND student. I’ve come to realize that a teacher’s role is to help people WANT to learn. I work with people of all ages, shapes, sizes and minds to help make learning interactive, practical and fun :) Children are our greatest teachers and I hope to learn from your kids and help them want to learn about themselves and the world around them.
